# GreenReserve — Claude Code Context

## What this is
GreenReserve is an OpenTable-style golf tee sheet platform. Golf courses list for free, golfers book online. Revenue model: $1.50/player service fee charged to the golfer at booking; courses keep 100% of green fees.

**Live URL:** https://greenreserve.app  
**Stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Prisma (PostgreSQL), Stripe Connect, Resend (email), Vercel

---

## Key architectural decisions

### Payment flow (deferred, not immediate)
- Golfers save a card at booking via Stripe SetupIntent — **nothing is charged at booking time**
- Charge happens at **check-in** via direct Stripe charge against the saved PaymentMethod
- Courses with no cancellation fee policy skip card collection entirely (no-card flow)
- Late cancellation fee: if golfer cancels after the window, the saved card is charged automatically by cron — this fee is refunded at check-in

### Booking status flow
```
confirmed → (check-in) → completed
confirmed → (cancel before window) → cancelled (no charge)
confirmed → (cancel after window) → cancelled (fee charged, non-refundable)
confirmed → (no-show, cron fires) → fee charged, booking still confirmed until check-in
```

### Check-in
- Staff check-in: `/dashboard` button → `POST /api/checkin/[bookingId]`
- Golfer self check-in: `/checkin/[bookingId]?token=...` (token-gated, emailed in confirmation)
- Both paths call shared `performCheckIn()` in `src/lib/checkin-booking.ts`

### Operator onboarding pipeline
Inquiry → `pending` → `in_review` → `details_requested` → `details_submitted` → `building` → `live`
Admin page manages all stages. Operators get dashboard access when approved.

## Build & deploy

### CRITICAL: build validation
`next.config.ts` has `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` — TypeScript type errors do NOT fail the build. Only **SWC parse errors** do.

To validate before pushing:
```bash
# Check for parse errors (mirrors what SWC does)
npm install @babel/parser   # one-time
node -e "
const {parse}=require('@babel/parser');
const fs=require('fs');
const src=fs.readFileSync('src/app/admin/page.tsx','utf8');
try{parse(src,{sourceType:'module',plugins:['typescript','jsx']});console.log('OK')}
catch(e){console.log('FAIL line:'+e.loc?.line+' '+e.message)}
"
```

### Deploy
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push
# Vercel auto-deploys from main, or:
npx vercel --prod
```

### Shipping to production

> **MIGRATION RULE (reversal from db-push era):** The project now uses real Prisma
> migrations. Schema changes go through `migrate dev` → commit migration file →
> `migrate deploy` on prod. `db push` is banned except on throwaway sandbox DBs.

**Small changes (no schema change):** push to main is fine — Vercel auto-deploys.

**Schema changes — checklist (every time, no exceptions):**
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
2. Point your local `.env` at a Neon branch DB (not prod):
   - Neon console → Branches → "Create branch" from production
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` + `DIRECT_URL` in `.env` to point to the branch
   - Set `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` to a second Neon branch (needed by `migrate dev`)
3. Generate the migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive-name>`
   - This creates `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql` — commit it
4. Push branch — Vercel auto-creates a preview deployment
5. In Vercel dashboard → the preview deployment → Settings → Environment Variables:
   override `DATABASE_URL` + `DIRECT_URL` to point to the Neon branch
6. `npx prisma migrate deploy` applies the migration to the Neon branch
7. Verify the feature on the preview URL
8. Merge PR to main → Vercel build runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically
9. Post-deploy: confirm `/api/health` returns 200 (DB query succeeds)
10. Run `npx prisma migrate status` — must show "Database schema is up to date"

**Never on prod:**
- `prisma migrate reset` — destructive
- `prisma db push` — bypasses migration history, causes drift
- `prisma db push --accept-data-loss` — destructive
- Direct `psql` writes without a backup step

**Required env vars for local migration work (add to .env, NOT committed):**
```
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...   # a second Neon branch, prisma migrate dev needs it
```
Cam: create a permanent "shadow" branch in Neon named `shadow-dev` and keep its URL
in `.env.local` only.

**Rollback:**
- Code: Vercel dashboard → Deployments → click prior deploy → "Promote to Production"
- Schema: Neon PITR (see docs/RESTORE.md) — point-in-time recovery in the console;
  or write a compensating migration (`migrate dev --name revert-x`)

**Vercel preview env status:** Vercel auto-creates preview deployments for every branch.
Preview deployments currently share the production DATABASE_URL unless manually
overridden per-deployment. For schema migrations, always override before running them.

### Session policy (per surface)

| Surface | Cookie | JWT TTL | Renewal |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| Admin employees (viewer/support/manager) | `admin_session` | 12h absolute | None — re-authenticate after 12h |
| Admin owner | `admin_session` | 12h absolute | None — 2FA at each login |
| Operator/staff dashboard | `gr_operator` | 7 days sliding | Reissued when >50% elapsed |
| Golfer | `gr_golfer` | 90 days sliding | Reissued when >50% elapsed |
| Member (per-course) | `gr_member` | 90 days absolute | None |

Sliding renewal is implemented in `src/lib/auth.ts` → `getOperatorSession()` / `getGolferSession()`.
Re-run `scripts/route-inventory.ts` after adding routes to keep ARCHITECTURE.md current.

### Doc-file commit rule
After every run, `git status` — if dirty:
- **Doc files** (`RUN_QUEUE.md`, `*_SPEC.md`, `CLAUDE.md`): COMMIT with message `"queue/spec update"` — never discard; Cowork edits them between runs.
- **Non-doc files**: `git checkout -- .` to discard.

First action of every run: commit any dirty doc files BEFORE reading the queue.

### Git index issue (sandbox-specific)
The git index in this repo sometimes gets corrupted in sandboxed environments. Workaround:
```bash
GIT_DIR=/tmp/git-work GIT_WORK_TREE=$(pwd) git add ...
GIT_DIR=/tmp/git-work GIT_WORK_TREE=$(pwd) git commit -m "..."
```

## Design system — Clubhouse (July 2026)

**All admin pages:** light mode, Clubhouse palette. Golfer pages still use white/gray-50 (D3 phase pending).

### Tailwind v4 custom tokens (defined in `globals.css` `@theme {}`)
- `paper` (#F6F4EC) — page bg; `card` (#FFFFFF) — card bg; `ink` (#1C1C18) — body text
- `ink-soft` (#6E6D64), `ink-muted` (#87867C), `ink-faint` (#98968B)
- `line` (#E6E3D7), `line-soft` (#F0EDE2), `line-strong` (#D9D6C8)
- `pine` (#24513B) / `pine-hover` (#2E6349) — admin accent
- `ok` (#3D6B4C), `bad` (#A3452F), `warn` (#8A6116), `dot-neutral` (#B3B1A6)
- `font-sans` = Inter, `font-serif` = Fraunces (page titles + stat numbers)

### Rules
- Max border-radius: `rounded-md` for buttons/inputs, `rounded-lg` for cards. Never `rounded-xl/2xl/3xl`.
- No emojis — use lucide-react icons
- Nav/Footer: suppressed on `/admin/*` and `/dashboard/*` paths (return null)
- Admin sidebar: `bg-pine`, inactive `text-[#A9BFAF]`, active `bg-white/10 text-paper`
- Page titles: `text-[22px] font-serif font-medium tracking-tight text-ink`
- Eyebrows: `text-[11px] uppercase tracking-[0.06em] text-ink-muted`
- Status indicators: `<StatusDot status="ok|bad|warn|neutral" label="..."/>` — 5px dot, no pill badges
- Input class: `bg-paper border border-line rounded-md px-3 py-2.5 text-ink placeholder-ink-faint focus:border-pine/40 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-pine/10`
- Primary button: `bg-pine hover:bg-pine-hover text-white font-medium rounded-md`
- Email template: sharp corners (`border-radius:4px`), black header bar, zinc border

### BANNED
- `font-black`, `tracking-widest` — use `font-medium`/`font-semibold` and `tracking-[0.06em]`
- Dark backgrounds (`bg-gray-950`, `bg-gray-900`) on admin/dashboard
- Tinted colored pill badges — use `<StatusDot>` instead
- `emerald-600` as accent — use `pine` / `ok` tokens

---

## Cron jobs (`src/app/api/cron/`)
- `charge-cancellation-fee` — fires at the cancellation cutoff, charges late cancellations, also sends check-in reminder for no-fee courses
- Triggered by Vercel cron (configured in `vercel.json`)

---

## Known gotchas
1. **File write truncation** — large files written via tool sometimes truncate. Always validate line count and parse after writing. Use `printf` or heredoc for smaller files.
2. **Null bytes from sed** — avoid using `sed -i` with shell-quoted patterns on these files. Use Python `re.sub()` instead.
3. **JSX multi-line ternaries** — SWC/Babel chokes on `? [...]` starting a new line inside JSX. Pre-compute filtered arrays before the `return` instead.
4. **Missing closing divs** — JSX parse errors often cascade from a missing `</div>` much earlier in the file. Binary-search with `@babel/parser` to find the true root.
5. **Stripe webhook** — must be registered in Stripe dashboard pointing to `/api/stripe/webhook`
