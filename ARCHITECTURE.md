**Auth-protected pages** — middleware redirects unauthenticated hits:
- `/admin/*` → redirects to `/admin/login`
- `/dashboard/*` → redirects to `/login`
- `/account/*` → redirects to `/account/login`

## Money Flow

```
1. BOOKING
   Golfer → POST /api/bookings
   → Stripe SetupIntent (card saved, nothing charged)
   → Booking.paymentStatus = 'card_on_file'

2. CANCELLATION FEE (late cancel — cron)
   Vercel cron → GET /api/cron/cancellation-cutoff
   → chargeOnConnectedAccount() (idempotencyKey: cancelfee-{id}-{pmId})
   → Booking.paymentStatus = 'cancellation_fee_charged'

3. CHECK-IN CHARGE
   Staff/Golfer → POST /api/checkin/[bookingId]
   → performCheckIn() in src/lib/checkin-booking.ts
   → Stripe charge on connected account + application fee ($1.50/player)
   → Cancellation fee refunded if previously charged
   → Booking.status = 'completed'

4. STRIPE WEBHOOKS  (src/app/api/stripe/webhook)
   account.updated → sync Course.stripeAccountActive
   (idempotent: updateMany with same value is safe to replay)
```

## Model Relationships (summary)

```
CourseOperator ──< Course ──< TeeTime ──< Booking >── GolferAccount
                          └──< TeeTimeSchedule
                          └──< MembershipTier ──< CourseMembership >── GolferAccount
                          └──< TeeSet
                          └──< CourseStaff
```

Key models:
- **Course** — slug, operator, pricing, policies, Stripe account, liveStatus
- **TeeTime** — generated slot; playersBooked/playersAvailable for capacity guard
- **Booking** — links GolferAccount + TeeTime; holds paymentMethodId; status flow: confirmed → completed/cancelled
- **CourseOperator** — operator login (2FA, hashed code), Stripe accountId
- **GolferAccount** — golfer login (bcrypt password, email-based auth)
- **CourseMembership / MembershipTier** — per-course membership with tier pricing
- **AdminUser** — admin console login (owner/manager/support/viewer roles)
- **RateLimit** — DB-backed rate limiter (per-key, window counts)
